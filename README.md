Crystal is an app for those who have ADHD, and can help with staying focused, organized, on time, and even unwind.

## Tech
### Frontend
Crystal's frontend utilizes React Native and Expo. Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

### Backend
Crystal's backend utilizes Node.js and Express. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Personal recommendations to users as well as automated sorting of user's notes use OpenAI's GPT-3 API.
